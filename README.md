- 👋 Hi, I’m Rosa Davis and I work for Vasion. My username is @rosadavisvasion
- 👀 I have a wide variety of interests ranging from photography, to travel, to technology and one of the best ways to combine a couple of these is to become a digital nomad. Not happening yet, but it'd be a cool option.
- 🌱 I’m a life-long learner and typically take a variety of courses but I'm taking a break right now and dedicating some spare time to reading fiction in a variety of genres ranging from fantasy to historical novels with a bit of sci-fi thrown in.
